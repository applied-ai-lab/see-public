## Changes to original repository
***This repository contains a change to the GCC version that is used for building in see_core/CMakeLists.txt,
as well as additional dependencies. Further, liblemon-dev is no longer available on official Ubuntu 20.04
repositories and thus the debian package is included here, too.***

==============================================================================


Surface Edge Explorer (SEE++)
==============================================================================

## Description

SEE++ is a density-based Next Best View (NBV) planning approach for obtaining 3D
scene observations.

## Installation

- Install Dependencies
  - sudo apt install libnlopt-dev libnlopt-cxx-dev libglpk40
  - sudo dpkg -i liblemon1.3.1_1.3.1+dfsg-1_amd64.deb
  - sudo dpkg -i liblemon-dev_1.3.1+dfsg-1_amd64.deb
- Install ROS Noetic (includes PCL)
  - http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu (use full desktop install)
- Clone SEE into your catkin workspace
  - cd ~/catkin_ws/src && git clone https://github.com/robotic-esp/see-public
- Build SEE with catkin
  - cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  - Using the 'Release' build enables PCL optimisations for the best performance

## Usage

- Specify the desired SEE parameters (i.e., view distance (d), radius (r),
  density (rho), frontier update limit (tau), occlusion search distance
  (psi) and visibility search distance (ups)), the sensor parameters
  (e.g., field-of-view, resolution and fps) and the ROS topic for sensor
  pointclouds (sen_pts_topic) in the launch file see_core/launch/run_see.launch
- Run the launch file
    - roslaunch see_core run_see.launch
- More information can be found on the doxygen webpage
  - https://robotic-esp.github.io/see-public/
